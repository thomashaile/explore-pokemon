A starter-project for pair programming.  All of the files are empty, but there are two similar projects you can study in [the Asynchronous Programming repo](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/asynchronous-programming/tree/master/integrate).  Your task is to fill in the code of this repository until your new code behaves just like [the obfuscated demo](./demo).

In this project you should practice the pair programming roles: [Driver and Navigator](https://gist.github.com/jordanpoulton/607a8854673d9f22c696):

* Choose one person on your team to be the main repository owner.  They will fork this repository and all team mates will fork from theirs.
* Everyone should take turns being the Driver, every 10 minutes:
    1. Push your code so far to GitHub (even if it isn't working!)
    1. Choose who will be the next driver
    1. The new driver will merge the most recent code to their repo and clone
    1. Code for 10 minutes.
    1. Repeat!
* When your group's project behaves the same as the demo, merge all changes into your group's repo.  You're done!
